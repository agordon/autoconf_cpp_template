TODO:
1. Change you package name in "configure.ac"
2. Create a git repository, use "git tag -a v0.1" to tag a version
   (it will be used automatically next time you run "./reconf")
3. If you need "libtool", enable it in "reconf" and "configure.ac"
4. If you need "boost", enable it in "configure.ac" and "src/Makefile.am"
5. Change the name of binary program in "src/Makefile.am"
6. update ".gitignore" as necessary
7. If you've cloned this program, delete the ".git" directory and start fresh with "git init"
